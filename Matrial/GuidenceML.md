# This is for guidence of Learning Machine Learning

- finding the approximate function that best describes the relationship between input data and the output data.
- The goal of machine learning is to enable the computers to learn from the data and make predictions.
- usage when
  i. we did not pin down mathematical relationship between input and output
  ii. we have sufficient data
  iii. pattern exists in data
- Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence(**prediction** of function from data)
