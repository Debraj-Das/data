# Break whole problem into some steps :
**Data Collection**: The first step is to collect the data. In this case, the data will be collected from the Online Retail dataset available on Kaggle.

**Data Anonymization**: The collected data will be anonymized to ensure that individual transactions cannot be traced back to the customers. This can be done using various data anonymization techniques such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, etc.

**Secure Multi-party Computation (SMPC)**: SMPC techniques will be used to perform computations on the encrypted transaction data. This ensures that the raw data remains confidential and only the results of the computations are revealed.

**Market Basket Analysis**: The anonymized and encrypted data will be used to perform market basket analysis. This is a data mining technique used by retailers to identify associations between items that are frequently bought together.

**Differential Privacy**: To further ensure privacy, differential privacy techniques will be applied. This involves adding a certain amount of noise to the results of the analysis to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information about specific transactions.

**Evaluation**: The system's effectiveness in terms of privacy protection and the usefulness of the analysis results for retail decision-making will be evaluated.

**Integration**: Finally, a demonstration of how the system can be integrated into retail analytics platforms for secure and privacy-preserving market basket analysis will be provided.
